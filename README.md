### Hi there! I'm Tammy (she/her) 👋

I'm a software and biomedical engineering student who loves creating things. My favourite languages are Python and Java, but Javascript is rising in my ranks. I love learning to use new APIs and frameworks during the time-crunch of a hackathon (and just attending hackathons overall). I am interested in further exploring the world of data science and the different fields of backend development.
